# Voice Shopping List

A React component for creating shopping lists using voice input. This component provides a seamless way to create and manage shopping lists using speech recognition, with fallback to a remote speech-to-text API.

## Features

- **Voice Input**: Record your shopping items using your voice
- **Text Input**: Traditional text input as an alternative
- **Audio File Upload**: Upload audio recordings for transcription
- **Multiple Speech Recognition Methods**:
  - Browser's Web Speech API for local processing
  - Vista API for server-side processing
  - OpenAI Whisper API (optional)
  - Automatic fallback if one method isn't available
- **Voice Visualization**: Real-time audio visualization during recording
- **Transcript Preview**: See what's being transcribed in real-time
- **List Management**:
  - Add, edit, delete items
  - Mark items as complete
  - Clear completed items
  - Clear all items
- **Command Recognition**: Special voice commands like "clear list", "delete last item"
- **Local Storage**: Persist lists between sessions
- **Download Options**: Download list in various formats (TXT, CSV, JSON, HTML)

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `title` | string | "Shopping List" | Title for the shopping list |
| `placeholder` | string | "Add an item..." | Placeholder text for the input field |
| `language` | string | "en-US" | Language for speech recognition |
| `maxItems` | number | 100 | Maximum number of items to keep in history |
| `storageKey` | string | "voice-shopping-list" | Local storage key for persisting the list |
| `enableStorage` | boolean | true | Enable or disable local storage persistence |
| `className` | string | "" | Custom CSS class for the component |
| `onListChange` | function | undefined | Event handler for when the list changes |

## Voice Commands

The component recognizes the following voice commands:

- "Clear list", "Clear the list", "Start over" - Clears the entire list
- "Delete last", "Remove last", "Undo last" - Removes the last added item
- "Mark all as done", "Complete all", "Check all" - Marks all items as completed

## Server API Integration

By default, the component tries to use the browser's Web Speech API. If that's not available, it falls back to the configured API endpoint. You can configure the endpoints in the `.env` file:

```
# Local server
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Or OpenAI Whisper API
VITE_USE_OPENAI_API=true
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

See `.env.example` for all available configuration options.

## Browser Compatibility

The Web Speech API is supported in:
- Chrome
- Edge
- Safari (limited support)
- Firefox (limited support)

For browsers without Web Speech API support, the component falls back to using the configured API endpoint.

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```
